# IoT device with Analog Reading 

A research project to develop IoT devices and PAR sensors to measure the photosynthetically active radiation. 

Arduino MKR NB 1500 was used to measure and transmit the data of PAR sensors to Azure through Telstra's Narrow Band Network. 

This is sample codes of the project and you need to set the PIN number and API settings of the  micro-SIM card in Arduino/PARbar_NBIoT_v14/arduino_secrets.h 

Python folder contains codes to download the data stored in the blob files of Azure and these are also sample codes.
